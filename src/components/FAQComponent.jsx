      question: "What is security film and how does it work?",
      answer: "Security film is a strong, clear layer applied to glass. It helps keep windows intact during impact, making break-ins much more difficult."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does installation take?",
      answer: "Installation time varies depending on the scope of work. Typically, window security film takes 2-5 hours, door reinforcements take 1-2 hours, and security cameras take 30-60 minutes per camera."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you only work with residential homes?",
      answer: " Our main focus is residential security, but we also provide services for commercial properties such as offices, shops, and storefronts."
    },
    {
      question: "Can window film help lower energy costs?",
      answer: "Yes. Security films block heat and up to 99% of UV rays, keeping your home cooler and reducing strain on your AC."
    },
    {
      question: " Will the film change how my windows look?",
      answer: "No, it wonâ€™t. Our security are designed with a clear adhesive that keeps your glass looking just the way it is. From both inside and outside, the appearance stays virtually the same, and it still lets natural daylight shine through."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide warranties?",
      answer: " Yes, our products and installations come with warranties for lasting protection and peace of mind."
